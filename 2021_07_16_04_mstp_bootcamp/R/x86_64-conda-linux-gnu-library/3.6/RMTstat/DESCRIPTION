Description: 
    Functions for working with the Tracy-Widom laws and other distributions 
    related to the eigenvalues of large Wishart matrices.
    The tables for computing the Tracy-Widom densities and distribution
    functions were computed by Momar Dieng's MATLAB package "RMLab"
    (formerly available on his homepage at 
    http://math.arizona.edu/~momar/research.htm ).
    This package is part of a collaboration between Iain Johnstone, 
    Zongming Ma, Patrick Perry, and Morteza Shahram.  It will soon be
    replaced by a package with more accuracy and built-in support for
    relevant statistical tests.
